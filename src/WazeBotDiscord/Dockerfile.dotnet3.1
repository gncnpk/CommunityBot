# Alpine-based .NET Core 2.1 install 
#       Alpine is a tiny Linux distro, often used in Docker containers for absolutely minimal image size

# Copy CS Proj in ONLY (this helps with caching layers, this is only redone
#    if the csproj changes
COPY *.csproj .

# The dotnet restore command installs all the deps listed in csproj
RUN dotnet restore

# NOW copy all our source in
COPY . .

# Going straight to publish forces a build.  
#   -o /app causes the build in a clean, standalone directory
#   --no-restore avoids doing the dependency install, as we know that just got done two 
#           steps ago
